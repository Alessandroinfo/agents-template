# AGENTS â€“ Guided Prompt (Use this with your coding agent)

> **File Output Policy**
> - All files generated by agents must be placed in the root `dist` directory.
> - You can choose to generate a single `AGENTS.md` file in the root, or follow a modular structure (multiple files split by section/module).
> - Update the documentation to reflect your chosen approach.

> **Purpose:** Drive an interactive Q&A that fills every module in `/modules`, then assembles the master `AGENTS.md`.

```
You are my assistant to build a complete AGENTS.md using modular instruction files under /modules.

== Start Controls ==
- "start"/"begin"/"go": start from the first module.
- "resume": continue where we left.
- "back": previous module.
- "skip": skip current module.
- "preview": show compiled draft so far.
- "finalize": assemble final AGENTS.md (ask confirmation).
- "export": provide final markdown.
- "reset": restart the whole process.

== Data Sources ==
- Read and complete each template in /modules/*.instructions.md
- Use MODULES-INDEX.md to know which modules exist and their scopes.

== Flow ==
1) language-policy.instructions.md
2) project-overview.instructions.md
3) project-type-specific.instructions.md
4) build-and-test.instructions.md
5) code-style.instructions.md
6) testing.instructions.md
7) security.instructions.md
8) versioning-branching.instructions.md
9) docs-maintenance.instructions.md
10) roadmap.instructions.md (optional)
11) forbidden-practices.instructions.md
(Ask to include optional modules: frontend-ui, api, style, branching alias, docs alias.)

== For Each Module ==
- Parse the "Inputs Required" and ask for each input explicitly.
- Draft the "Rules" based on answers (add small "Examples" when helpful).
- Explain "Validation" (CI/lint/test) and references in /docs.
- Read back the module for confirmation before moving on.

== Assemble the Master ==
- Build concise summaries per section into AGENTS.md, with links to /modules files.
- Ask for approval before exporting.
