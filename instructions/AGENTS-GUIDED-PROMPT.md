# Guided Generation – LLM-Assisted Method

**Let an AI agent guide you through creating complete agent instructions.**

---

## How to Use This Prompt

### Step 1: Copy the Prompt
Scroll down to the prompt block (marked with triple backticks ```) and **copy the entire content**.

### Step 2: Paste into Your AI Agent
Open your AI coding agent:
- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **GitHub Copilot** Chat
- **Cursor** IDE
- **Gemini** Code Assist
- Or any LLM-based coding assistant

Paste the entire prompt into the chat.

### Step 3: Start the Process
Type **`start`** and press Enter.

### Step 4: Answer Questions
The agent will:
1. Ask you specific questions about your project for each module
2. Generate rules and examples based on your answers
3. Show you each completed module for confirmation
4. Assemble everything into a complete `AGENTS.md` file

### Step 5: Review and Export
When finished, the agent will:
- Show you a preview of the complete `AGENTS.md`
- Ask for your approval
- Export files to `/dist/` directory (never overwrites source templates)

**Expected time**: 30-90 minutes depending on project complexity.

---

## What You'll Get

After completion:
- **`/dist/AGENTS.md`** - Master instruction file for your AI agents
- **`/dist/modules/*.instructions.md`** - All completed module files
- Ready-to-use agent instructions customized for your project

---

## The Prompt

Copy everything inside the code block below:

> **File Output Policy**
> - All files generated by agents must be placed in the root `dist` directory.
> - You can choose to generate a single `AGENTS.md` file in the root, or follow a modular structure (multiple files split by section/module).
> - Update the documentation to reflect your chosen approach.

> **Purpose:** Drive an interactive Q&A that fills every module in `/modules`, then assembles the master `AGENTS.md`.

```
You are my assistant to build a complete AGENTS.md using modular instruction files under /modules.

== Start Controls ==
- "start"/"begin"/"go": start from the first module.
- "resume": continue where we left.
- "back": previous module.
- "skip": skip current module.
- "preview": show compiled draft so far.
- "finalize": assemble final AGENTS.md (ask confirmation).
- "export": provide final markdown.
- "reset": restart the whole process.

== Data Sources ==
- Read and complete each template in /modules/*.instructions.md
- Use MODULES-INDEX.md to know which modules exist and their scopes.

== Flow ==
1) language-policy.instructions.md
2) project-overview.instructions.md
3) project-type-specific.instructions.md
4) tools-commands.instructions.md
5) agent-persona.instructions.md
6) boundaries-permissions.instructions.md
7) agentic-patterns.instructions.md
8) context-management.instructions.md
9) build-and-test.instructions.md
10) code-style.instructions.md
11) testing.instructions.md
12) security.instructions.md
13) versioning-branching.instructions.md
14) docs-maintenance.instructions.md
15) roadmap.instructions.md (optional)
16) forbidden-practices.instructions.md
(Ask to include optional modules: frontend-ui, api, style, branching alias, docs alias.)

== For Each Module ==
- Parse the "Inputs Required" and ask for each input explicitly.
- Draft the "Rules" based on answers (add small "Examples" when helpful).
- Explain "Validation" (CI/lint/test) and references in /docs.
- Read back the module for confirmation before moving on.

== Assemble the Master ==

- Build concise summaries per section into **AGENTS.md**, with links to /modules files.
- Everything must be in English.
- Ask for approval before exporting.
- When exporting, always generate files inside a new folder **/dist** at the repo root:
  - `/dist/AGENTS.md` → compiled master file
  - `/dist/modules/*.instructions.md` → compiled versions of each module
- Never overwrite source templates in `/modules/`; always keep them as input references.
- Confirm with me before writing anything in `/dist/`.
```
